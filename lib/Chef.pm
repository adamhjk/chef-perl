=head1 NAME

Chef - Write Chef recipes in Perl instead of Ruby.

Learn more about Chef - L<http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef>

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 WARNING

This is a proof of concept - it shows the path for future integration, but all the steps are not complete. What remains:

  * You cannot write Attribute or Definition files in Perl.
  * At the moment, all your Perl recipes must live in the same cookbook.
  * There is very little error handling. (ah, who am I kidding - there is none)

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';
our $recipe  = Chef::Recipe->new;
our $node_data;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Example:
  
  use Chef;
  
  resource file => '/tmp/foo', sub {
    my $r = shift;
    $r->owner('adam');
    $r->action('create');
  };
  
  resource file => '/tmp/' . node->{attributes}->{hostname} . "_created_with_perl", sub {
    my $r = shift;
    $r->action('create');
  };
  
Would create a file called /tmp/foo, and one called /tmp/HOSTNAME_created_with_perl. (Where HOSTNAME is, well, your hostname).

To use this module, you will need to install Chef, place the included cookbook in your cookbook repository, and place your perl based recipes in files/default/perl_recipes.

=head1 EXPORT

We export two functions in to your namespace, resource and node.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=cut

sub INIT {
  load_node();
}

=head2 node

Returns the Chef::Node object.  This allows you to see what recipes are applied to this node via:

  node->{recipes} # Returns an array of recipe names
  
Also allows you to access all the nodes attributes via:

  node->{attributes} # Returns all the nodes attributes
  
Any changes you make to the node object do not currently persist back in to Chef. (ie: you cannot use them in subsequent recipes.)  This is likely to change once integration is complete.

=cut
sub node {
  return $node_data;
}

sub load_node {
  my $data;
  while ( my $line = <STDIN> ) {
    $data = $data . $line;
  }
  $node_data = JSON::Any->jsonToObj($data);
  1;
}

=head2 resource

Create a new Chef Resource.  Valid resources are listed at:

  L<http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources>
  
An example of translating from the ruby version to perl:

  # The ruby version
  package "sudo" do
    action :install
  end

  # Make sure sudo is always at the latest version
  resource package => "sudo", sub {
    my $r = shift;
    $r->action("upgrade");
  }
  
Essentially, you create new resources by calling this method with the resource type (package, remote_file, etc.), resource name ("sudo", "/tmp/foo"), and a subroutine which recives a Chef::Resource object.  You can then set attributes of the resource via that object. (Hence, my $r = shift).

=cut
sub resource {
  my $resource_type = shift;
  my $resource_name = shift;
  my $resource_sub  = shift;

  my $resource = Chef::Resource->new(
    {
      resource_type => $resource_type,
      name          => $resource_name,
      resource_sub  => $resource_sub
    }
  );
  $resource->evaluate();
  $recipe->add_resource($resource);
}

sub send_to_chef {
  print JSON::Any->objToJson(
    {
      node                => $node_data,
      resource_collection => $recipe->prepare_json
    }
  );
}

sub END {
  send_to_chef;
}
