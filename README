Chef

WARNING

This is a proof of concept - it shows the path for future integration, but all the steps are not complete. What remains:

  * You cannot write Attribute or Definition files in Perl.
  * At the moment, all your Perl recipes must live in the same cookbook.
  * There is very little error handling. (ah, who am I kidding - there is none)
